This is my code for the shell lab assignment of the Computer Systems course at CU Boulder.

If you are a student looking for solutions I urge you to actually sift through the code and not simply copy-paste.  This stuff is actually pretty cool once you understand it.

Also everything you need to know about this lab is in chapter 8 of the 2nd edition of the Computer Systems textbook that your class is probably using.  Reading chapter 8 in its entirety was part of the lab for my class, and I strongly recommend doing it.

Let me know if you find any errors or bugs.
